We have been following worldwide updates regarding the now considered pandemic of the COVID-19 and things have not improved over time. At times like these the most sensible decision is to not bring people together. 

It is because of this and with great sadness that we have decided to **postpone ng-caribe 2020 indefinitely.**

### What's happening next?

We'll stay active on social media and will announce a new date over all of our channels once it's safe to have massive gatherings again.

We've received a tremendous amount of submissions during these first two months and some of you were already selected. Those that have been selected will keep their status and we'll be in contact with them soon.

We are really sorry about the inconveniences this new may bring to our beloved community.

We also would like to thank you all for all the support you have showered us with. We hope we can send it back by bringing ng-caribe to reality.

Sincerely,

ng-caribe's Staff.
