Hi.

We are sad to announce that **ng-caribe 2020 has been cancelled.**

First of all, sorry it took us so long to publish something regarding this issue. We made a huge fuss about our event and then went radio silent for months. It is not the way we would have wanted things to happen, but every single person can say that at this moment.

We have been following worldwide updates regarding the now considered pandemic of the COVID-19 and things have not improved over time. At times like these the most sensible decision is to not bring people together. 

##What's happening next?

The world is not at its best moments right now. We think that now is time to focus on the fight for human rights. [#BlackLivesMatter](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/naacp-1)

When the right time comes, we will be back with more positive news. Promise.

Until then, take care and stay strong.

Sincerely,

The ng-caribe Team
